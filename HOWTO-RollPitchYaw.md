# Roll, Pitch, Yaw (RPY)
The values for Pitch and Yaw are critical for proper AP behavior, currently the Autopilot does not utilize Yaw
as it is much to slow.  

Take the RPY values from Outfitting, pay attention to the Order, it is Pitch, Roll, Yaw in Outfitting.  Also pay
attention to the order on the GUI as it too is Roll, Pitch, Yaw.

  for your ship and reduce the Roll by 10 to 15 and Pitch by 5 to 10.  The values in outfitting are for when 
  your ship is not in supercruise, the performance is worse in supercruise.

  Control Rates: Must provide the roll, pitch, yaw rates as defined in Outfitting for your ship, you probably 
  want to save the config. Each ship is different. The rates shown in Outfitting are for normal space, in 
  supercriuse they will be a little slower.
